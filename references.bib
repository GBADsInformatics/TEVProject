  abstract = {Understanding the global economic importance of farmed animals to
              society is essential as a baseline for decision making about future
              food systems. We estimated the annual global economic (market)
              value of live animals and primary production outputs, e.g., meat,
              eggs, milk, from terrestrial and aquatic farmed animal systems. The
              results suggest that the total global market value of farmed
              animals ranges between 1.61 and 3.3 trillion USD (2018) and is
              expected to be similar in absolute terms to the market value of
              crop outputs (2.57 trillion USD). The cattle sector dominates the
              market value of farmed animals. The study highlights the need to
              consider other values of farmed animals to society, e.g.,
              finance/insurance value and cultural value, in decisions about the
              sectorâ€™s future.},
