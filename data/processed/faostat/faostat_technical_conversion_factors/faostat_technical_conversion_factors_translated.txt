Technical Conversion Factors

for Agricultural Commodities


Introduction

This publication contains technical conversion factors and ancillary information
currently used by the Statistics Division of FAO to compile commodity balances and
supply/utilization accounts for nearly all the countries in the world. The main scope of these
balances and accounts is ultimately to arrive at approximate estimates of the total availability
of food in each country, expressed in terms of quantity as well as in terms of calories, protein
and fat.


The contents of this publication differ from that shown in similar publications issued
by FAO in the past (1960 and 1972) mainly for three reasons: i) Simple conversion factors
used to convert local non-metric measures into metric weight equivalent are no longer shown
because almost all countries now report their statistics in metric units. ii) The technical
conversion factors shown here are limited almost exclusively to edible products.              iii)
Technical conversion factors are now restricted, with few exceptions, to primary crops,
livestock and primary livestock products up to the first stage of processing, and only for those
products for which an account is constructed for a given country


All conversion factors included are based on the most recently available information
and are intended to reflect current conditions and practices.


The conversion factors shown in this publication contain the information received in
response to a questionnaire sent to member nations.          As not all countries replied, this
provisional issue of the publication is being released not only to meet the immediate needs of
the users, but also to obtain proposals for corrections and for the inclusion of any additional
information.


Interested readers will also find in the publication the “Commodity Trees” for the
most important primary commodities. A commodity tree is a symbolic representation of the
flow from a primary commodity to various processed products derived from it, together with
the conversion factors from one commodity to another.
REMARKS


In general, most of the concepts used in this publication are self-explanatory.
However, some of them need a few words of explanation. These can be seen in the following
paragraphs:


1.    Coverage of data - All data relate to national annual averages for the five-year period,
1992-1996.


2.     Seeding rates – Amounts of the commodity concerned, expressed in kilograms per
hectare, used for sowing purposes; not only for crops harvested dry, but also for crops
harvested green for fodder or food.
For vegetables and melons, figures under this heading generally relate to vegetables
and melons seeds, and for fruits and berries, to number of plants per hectare.


3.    Waste of supply – Amounts of the commodity concerned, expressed as percent of
supply – production plus imports – covering waste and losses occurring between the
level at which production is recorded and the household - that is, waste in storage and
transportation.


4.    Extraction rates – This concept relates to processed products only and indicates, in
percent terms, the amount of the processed product concerned obtained from the
processing of the parent/originating product, in most cases a primary product. For
example, flour from wheat, oil from soybeans, shelled from unshelled almonds, cheese
from milk, etc.


In certain cases, the extraction rate is higher than 100.       This happens when the
processed product contains, in addition to the primary product, something else: water,
salt, sugar, oil, etc.


5.    Birth rate – The number of animals born alive per 100 females having given birth
during the whole year.


6.    Take-off rate – The number of animals taken out from the national herd during the
year to be slaughtered in the country or exported alive. These numbers are expressed
as a percent of all animals of the same species which were present in the country at the
time of enumeration of the same year, including newborn animals, for example, day-
old chicks.


7.     Live weight – This refers to the average live weight of slaughtered animals.


8.     Carcass weight – This means dressed carcass weight, i.e. the weight of the carcass
after removal of edible and inedible parts, particularly hides and skins, offals and
slaughter fats.


9.     Edible offals – Those edible parts or organs of the animals, other than fats, which are
usually separated in the course of preparation of the carcasses at the slaughterhouses.


10.    Slaughter fats – Unrendered fats, edible and inedible, which fall in the course of
dressing the carcasses.

Introduction


This publication contains technical conversion factors and other information
currently used by the Statistics Division of FAO to compile balance sheets of
products and availability/usage accounts for almost all countries in the world. the
main purpose of these balance sheets/accounts is to arrive at the end at a rough estimate of the
total food availability in each country in terms of quantity, calories, protein
and fat.

The content of this publication differs from that of similar publications disseminated by the
FAO in the past (1960 and 1972) for three main reasons: i) Conversion factors
simple used to convert local non-metric measurements to their weight equivalent
metric are no longer present because almost all countries now use the units
metrics for their statistics. ii) The technical conversion factors used here are limited
almost exclusively to edibles. iii) Technical conversion factors are
limited, with a few exceptions, to primary agricultural products, livestock and products
animal husbandry, up to the level of the first stage of processing, and only for
products selected for the preparation of the accounts in a given country.

All the conversion factors used are based on the most recent information and
represent current conditions and practices.

The conversion factors used in this publication take into account information
received in response to questionnaires sent to member countries. Since all countries
did not respond, this interim publication is intended to meet the immediate needs of
users, and also to obtain proposals for corrections and inclusions of information
additional.

Interested readers can also consult in the publication "the trees of
products” for information on the most important primary products. "The tree of
product” is a symbolic representation of the flow from the primary product to the products
derived by transformation with conversion factors from one product to another.
REMARKS



In general, most of the concepts used in this publication are self-explanatory.

same. Nevertheless, some of them need some explanation. These are found

in the following paragraphs:



1. Data coverage - All data refer to annual national averages

for the five-year period, 1992-1996.



2. Seeding rate - Quantities of the product concerned, expressed in kilograms per

hectare, used for seed; not only for dry harvested products, but also

for those harvested fresh for fodder and food.

For vegetables and melons, data under this heading refer, in general, to

seeds of vegetables and melons, and for fruits and berries, to the number of plants per hectare.



3. Waste from availability - Quantities of the product concerned, expressed as a percentage of

availability - production plus imports - covering losses and waste occurring

between the time of the production record and the household – i.e., storage waste and

transport.



4. Extraction coefficients - This concept refers to processed products obtained from

the development of the parent/original product, in most cases a primary product. By

example, flour from wheat, oil from soybeans, almonds

peeled from those in the shell, cheese from milk, etc.
Occasionally the extraction coefficient is greater than 100. This happens when the product

elaborated contains, in addition to the original product, something else: water, salt, sugar, oil,

etc.



5. Birth Coefficient - The number of animals born alive per 100 females that gave

birth throughout the year.



6. Slaughter factor - The number of animals taken from the national herd during the year

to slaughter them in the country or export them on the hoof. These figures are expressed in

percentage of all animals of the same species that were present in the country at

time of enumeration of the same year, included newborn animals, for example,

day-old chicks.



7. Liveweight – This is the average liveweight of slaughtered animals.



8. Carcass weight - This means dressed carcass weight, i.e. the carcass weight after

removal of edible and inedible parts, in particular skins, offal and

slaughter fats.



9. Edible Offal - Those edible parts or organs of animals, other than fat, which

are usually separated during carcass preparation at slaughterhouses.



10. Slaughter fats - Unrendered fats, edible and inedible, which fall to the

time of carcass preparation.

INTRODUCTION

This publication contains technical conversion coefficients and auxiliary information
currently used by the FAO Statistics Division to record the balance of
commodity and supply accounts and their use for almost all countries in the
world. The main scope of these balance sheets and accounts is primarily to arrive at the
Rough estimates of total food availability in each country, expressed in
terms of quantity as well as in terms of calories, protein and fat.

The content of this publication differs from previous publications published by FAO
in the years 1960 and 1972 mainly for three reasons: I) Simple factors are not published
conversion methods used to convert local non-metric measurements to
metric system weight measurements as most countries report their statistics
in metric units. II) The conversion factors given here are limited almost
exclusively for food products. III) These conversion factors refer only,
with some exceptions, to primary crops, livestock, the primary products of
livestock in the first stage of processing, and only to products for which
an account is built for a given country.

All conversion factors included here are based on the latest information.
available and attempts to show current conditions and existing practices.

The conversion factors in this publication contain the information provided in the
questionnaires sent to member countries. As not all countries responded, this
provisional edition is published not only to satisfy the immediate needs of the
users, but also to obtain proposals for corrections and for the inclusion of
any additional information.

Interested readers will also find the “Product Trees” in the publication.
for the most important primary products. The “tree” of a product is a
symbolic representation of the flow from a primary product to various processed products
derived from it, together with the conversion factors from one product to another.
OBSERVATIONS



Generally, most of the concepts used in this publication are

they explain themselves. However, some of them require a few more explanations,

offered in the following paragraphs.



1. Scope of data – All data refer to annual national averages for the

five-year period 1992-1996.



2. Planting density – Quantities of the product in question, expressed in kilograms

per hectare, used for planting; not only for dry harvested crops, but

also those harvested green for human or animal consumption.

For vegetables and melons, data under this heading generally refer to seeds

for vegetables and melons, and for fruits and berries, to the number of plants per hectare.



3. Supply waste – Quantities of the product in question, expressed as

percentage of supply – production plus imports – that cover losses and

waste that occurs between the time production is recorded and the time

products reach homes. Practically, losses during the

storage and transportation.



4. Extraction coefficients – This concept applies only to products

elaborated, indicating, in percentage, the amount of the elaborated product that is

obtained with the transformation of a parent/original product, usually a
primary product. For example, wheat flour, soybean oil, peeled almonds

shelled almonds, milk cheese, etc.



Sometimes the extraction coefficient is greater than 100. This happens when the product

processed contains other products besides the original product: water, salt, sugar,

oil etc



5. Fertility coefficient – The number of animals born alive per 100 females that

have calved during the year.



6. Slaughter coefficient – The number of animals removed from the herd

during the year for slaughter in the country or for export alive to other

countries. That number is expressed here as a percentage of all animals in the

same species that were present in the country at the time of the livestock census of the

same year, including newborn animals; for example, day-old chicks.



7. Live weight – This is the average live weight of the slaughtered animals.



8. Weight of the carcass - This is the prepared carcass, that is, after removing the parts

edible and inedible, particularly hides and skins, offal and fats of

slaughterhouse.



9. Edible offal – These are the edible parts or organs of animals, with

exception of the fats, which are usually separated during the preparation of the carcasses in

the slaughterhouses.
10. Slaughterhouse Fats - Edible and inedible unrendered fats that are

come off in the process of preparing the carcasses.

Introduction

This publication contains technical conversion factors and ancillary information
currently used by the Statistics Division of FAO to compile commodity balances and
supply/utilization accounts for nearly all the countries in the world. The main scope of these
balances and accounts is ultimately to arrive at approximate estimates of the total availability
of food in each country, expressed in terms of quantity as well as in terms of calories, protein
and fat.


The contents of this publication differ from that shown in similar publications issued
by FAO in the past (1960 and 1972) mainly for three reasons: i) Simple conversion factors
used to convert local non-metric measures into metric weight equivalent are no longer shown
because almost all countries now report their statistics in metric units. ii) The technical
conversion factors shown here are limited almost exclusively to edible products.              iii)
Technical conversion factors are now restricted, with few exceptions, to primary crops,
livestock and primary livestock products up to the first stage of processing, and only for those
products for which an account is constructed for a given country


All conversion factors included are based on the most recently available information
and are intended to reflect current conditions and practices.


The conversion factors shown in this publication contain the information received in
response to a questionnaire sent to member nations.          As not all countries replied, this
provisional issue of the publication is being released not only to meet the immediate needs of
the users, but also to obtain proposals for corrections and for the inclusion of any additional
information.


Interested readers will also find in the publication the “Commodity Trees” for the
most important primary commodities. A commodity tree is a symbolic representation of the
flow from a primary commodity to various processed products derived from it, together with
the conversion factors from one commodity to another.
REMARKS


In general, most of the concepts used in this publication are self-explanatory.
However, some of them need a few words of explanation. These can be seen in the following
paragraphs:


1.    Coverage of data - All data relate to national annual averages for the five-year period,
1992-1996.


2.     Seeding rates – Amounts of the commodity concerned, expressed in kilograms per
hectare, used for sowing purposes; not only for crops harvested dry, but also for crops
harvested green for fodder or food.
For vegetables and melons, figures under this heading generally relate to vegetables
and melons seeds, and for fruits and berries, to number of plants per hectare.


3.    Waste of supply – Amounts of the commodity concerned, expressed as percent of
supply – production plus imports – covering waste and losses occurring between the
level at which production is recorded and the household - that is, waste in storage and
transportation.


4.    Extraction rates – This concept relates to processed products only and indicates, in
percent terms, the amount of the processed product concerned obtained from the
processing of the parent/originating product, in most cases a primary product. For
example, flour from wheat, oil from soybeans, shelled from unshelled almonds, cheese
from milk, etc.


In certain cases, the extraction rate is higher than 100.       This happens when the
processed product contains, in addition to the primary product, something else: water,
salt, sugar, oil, etc.


5.    Birth rate – The number of animals born alive per 100 females having given birth
during the whole year.


6.    Take-off rate – The number of animals taken out from the national herd during the
year to be slaughtered in the country or exported alive. These numbers are expressed
as a percent of all animals of the same species which were present in the country at the
time of enumeration of the same year, including newborn animals, for example, day-
old chicks.


7.     Live weight – This refers to the average live weight of slaughtered animals.


8.     Carcass weight – This means dressed carcass weight, i.e. the weight of the carcass
after removal of edible and inedible parts, particularly hides and skins, offals and
slaughter fats.


9.     Edible offals – Those edible parts or organs of the animals, other than fats, which are
usually separated in the course of preparation of the carcasses at the slaughterhouses.


10.    Slaughter fats – Unrendered fats, edible and inedible, which fall in the course of
dressing the carcasses.

Introduction


This publication contains technical conversion factors and other information
currently used by the Statistics Division of FAO to compile balance sheets of
products and availability/usage accounts for almost all countries in the world. the
main purpose of these balance sheets/accounts is to arrive at the end at a rough estimate of the
total food availability in each country in terms of quantity, calories, protein
and fat.

The content of this publication differs from that of similar publications disseminated by the
FAO in the past (1960 and 1972) for three main reasons: i) Conversion factors
simple used to convert non-metric local measurements to their weight equivalent
metric are no longer present because almost all countries now use the units
metrics for their statistics. ii) The technical conversion factors used here are limited
almost exclusively to edibles. iii) Technical conversion factors are
limited, with a few exceptions, to primary agricultural products, livestock and products
animal husbandry, up to the level of the first stage of processing, and only for
products selected for the preparation of the accounts in a given country.

All the conversion factors used are based on the most recent information and
represent current conditions and practices.

The conversion factors used in this publication take into account information
received in response to questionnaires sent to member countries. Since all countries
did not respond, this interim publication is intended to meet the immediate needs of
users, and also to obtain proposals for corrections and inclusions of information
additional.

Interested readers can also consult in the publication "the trees of
products” for information on the most important primary products. "The tree of
product” is a symbolic representation of the flow from the primary product to the products
derived by transformation with conversion factors from one product to another.
REMARKS



In general, most of the concepts used in this publication are self-explanatory.

same. Nevertheless, some of them need some explanation. These are found

in the following paragraphs:



1. Data coverage - All data refer to annual national averages

for the five-year period, 1992-1996.



2. Seeding rate - Quantities of the product concerned, expressed in kilograms per

hectare, used for seed; not only for dry harvested products, but also

for those harvested fresh for fodder and food.

For vegetables and melons, data under this heading refer, in general, to

seeds of vegetables and melons, and for fruits and berries, to the number of plants per hectare.



3. Waste from availability - Quantities of the product concerned, expressed as a percentage of

availability - production plus imports - covering losses and waste occurring

between the time of the production record and the household – i.e., storage waste and

transport.



4. Extraction coefficients - This concept refers to processed products obtained from

the development of the parent/original product, in most cases a primary product. By

example, flour from wheat, oil from soybeans, almonds

shelled from those in shell, cheese from milk, etc.
Occasionally the extraction coefficient is greater than 100. This happens when the product

elaborated contains, in addition to the original product, something else: water, salt, sugar, oil,

etc.



5. Birth Coefficient - The number of animals born alive per 100 females that gave

birth throughout the year.



6. Slaughter factor - The number of animals taken from the national herd during the year

to slaughter them in the country or export them on the hoof. These figures are expressed in

percentage of all animals of the same species that were present in the country at

time of enumeration of the same year, included newborn animals, for example,

day old chicks.



7. Liveweight – This is the average liveweight of slaughtered animals.



8. Carcass weight - This means dressed carcass weight, i.e. the carcass weight after

removal of edible and inedible parts, in particular skins, offal and

slaughter fats.



9. Edible Offal - Those edible parts or organs of animals, other than fat, which

are usually separated during carcass preparation at slaughterhouses.



10. Slaughter fats - Unrendered fats, edible and inedible, which fall to the

time of carcass preparation.

INTRODUCTION

This publication contains technical conversion coefficients and auxiliary information
currently used by the FAO Statistics Division to record the balance of
commodity and supply accounts and their use for almost all countries in the
world. The main scope of these balance sheets and accounts is primarily to arrive at the
rough estimates of total food availability in each country , expressed in
terms of quantity as well as in terms of calories, protein and fat.

The content of this publication differs from previous publications published by FAO
in the years 1960 and 1972 mainly for three reasons: I) Simple factors are not published
conversion methods used to convert local non-metric measurements to
metric system weight measurements as most countries report their statistics
in metric units. II) The conversion factors given here are limited almost
exclusively for food products. III) These conversion factors refer only,
with some exceptions, to primary crops, livestock, the primary products of
livestock in the first stage of processing, and only to products for which
an account is built for a given country.

All conversion factors included here are based on the latest information.
available and attempts to show current conditions and existing practices.

The conversion factors in this publication contain the information provided in the
questionnaires sent to member countries. As not all countries responded, this
provisional edition is published not only to satisfy the immediate needs of the
users, but also to obtain proposals for corrections and for the inclusion of
any additional information.

Interested readers will also find the “Product Trees” in the publication.
for the most important primary products. The “tree” of a product is a
symbolic representation of the flow from a primary product to various processed products
derived from it, together with the conversion factors from one product to another.
OBSERVATIONS



Generally, most of the concepts used in this publication are

they explain themselves. However, some of them require a few more explanations,

offered in the following paragraphs.



1. Scope of data – All data refer to annual national averages for the

five-year period 1992-1996.



2. Planting density – Quantities of the product in question, expressed in kilograms

per hectare, used for planting; not only for dry harvested crops, but

also those harvested green for human or animal consumption.

For vegetables and melons, data under this heading generally refer to seeds

for vegetables and melons, and for fruits and berries, to the number of plants per hectare.



3. Supply waste – Quantities of the product in question, expressed as

percentage of supply – production plus imports – that cover losses and

waste that occurs between the time production is recorded and the time

products reach homes. Practically, losses during the

storage and transportation.



4. Extraction coefficients – This concept applies only to products

elaborated, indicating, in percentage, the amount of the elaborated product that is

obtained with the transformation of a parent/original product, usually a
primary product. For example, wheat flour, soybean oil, peeled almonds

shelled almonds, milk cheese, etc.



Sometimes the extraction coefficient is greater than 100. This happens when the product

processed contains other products besides the original product: water, salt, sugar,

oil etc



5. Fertility coefficient – The number of animals born alive per 100 females that

have calved during the year.



6. Slaughter coefficient – The number of animals removed from the herd

during the year for slaughter in the country or for export alive to other

countries. That number is expressed here as a percentage of all animals in the

same species that were present in the country at the time of the livestock census of the

same year, including newborn animals; for example, day-old chicks.



7. Live weight – This is the average live weight of the slaughtered animals.



8. Weight of the carcass - This is the prepared carcass, that is, after removing the parts

edible and inedible, particularly hides and skins, offal and fats of

slaughterhouse.



9. Edible offal – These are the edible parts or organs of animals, with

exception of the fats, which are usually separated during the preparation of the carcasses in

the slaughterhouses.
10. Slaughterhouse Fats - Edible and inedible unrendered fats that are

come off in the process of preparing the carcasses.
