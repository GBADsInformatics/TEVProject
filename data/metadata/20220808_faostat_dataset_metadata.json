Additional variables included in the ACS are Net and Gross Capital Stock, Consumption of Fixed Capital, the Agriculture Investment ratio, and the Gross Fixed Capital Formation Agriculture Orientation Index. The FAO Agriculture Capital Stock Database is an analytical database: whenever available, the database integrates official National Accounts data harvested from the UNSD National Accounts Main Aggregates Database (UNSD AMA) and the OECD Annual National Accounts Database (OECD ANA). The database is further supplemented by OECD Structural Analysis database (OECD STAN) and in a few countries data from the country’s statistics website. If the full set of official data is not available for any specific country, imputation methods are applied to obtain estimates over the complete time series. Many data points in ACS are estimated and are flagged as such; they do not represent official Member countries' submissions. With a view of producing internationally comparable net capital stock estimates, we employ the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) with a time invariant geometric depreciation rate to impute missing data. The Perpetual Inventory Method is a well-established economic model to calculate Net Capital Stocks (NCS) and Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFC) from time series of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Specifically, annual measures of the NCS are obtained from cumulating historical series on physical investment flows and deducting the part of assets that are depreciated (the Consumption of Fixed Capital that occurs in every period). In order to implement the PIM, long time series on aggregate GFCF in agriculture, forestry and fishing is required. As much as possible, we rely on National Accounts data published by the OECD and UNSD. When country data are partially or fully missing, we employ econometric techniques to impute missing observations. Depending on the pattern of data missingness for the countries, different imputation methods are applied (selected from the ARMAX, PANEL and OLS classes of econometric models) for the data series from 1995 to 2018.The values of Agriculture Capital Stock related indicators for 2020, including Agriculture Investment Ratio, Agriculture Orientation Index, Net Capital Stock, Gross Fixed Capital Formation and Consumption of Fixed Capital, are estimated using the Holt-Winters (HW) method (Cipra et al., 1995). The HW method is an exponential smoothing method for forecasting the annual values of economic variables. In this context, the HW method relies on existing (historical) values of the Agriculture Capital Stock. The predicted value is an extrapolation of the historical values to the specified target date, which extends the timeline without considering seasonality in the annual series.All data series in the database are provided both in national currencies and in US dollars as well as in current prices and constant prices with base year 2015. Calculation of constant price series is done applying GFCF deflator series. When OECD National Accounts data are available, an OECD implicit deflator for agriculture GFCF is calculated and used. For other cases, the implicit deflators on GFCF for total economy available from the FAOSTAT Deflators database is used.","Contact":"Ms. Boero Veronica / Mr. Vollaro Michele","Email":"macrostats@fao.org","DateUpdate":"2021-09-24T00:00:00","CompressionFormat":"zip","FileType":"csv","FileSize":"1193KB","FileRows":130578,"FileLocation":"https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Investment_CapitalStock_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip"}, {"DatasetCode":"EA","DatasetName":"Investment: Development Flows to Agriculture","Topic":"All sectors with an emphasis on the Agriculture, forestry and fishing sector","DatasetDescription":"The Development Flows to Agriculture (DFA) dataset is an important component of Agricultural Investment Financing Statistics, together with Government Expenditures on Agriculture (GEA), Foreign Direct Investment in Agriculture (FDI), Credit to Agriculture (C2A) and Foreign Remittances (FR).  The DFA dataset relies on the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS), which provides comprehensive data on development flows from all donors to all recipients since the early 1970s. The use of CRS for compiling the DFA dataset capitalizes on the expertise of the OECD in this area, while minimizing respondents’ burden and avoiding duplication of work. The DFA dataset includes Official Development Assistance (ODA) flows, Other Official Flows (OOFs) and Private Grants reported by donor countries, international organizations and private entities to the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Directorate. The objective of the DFA database is to provide readily available data to enable analysis on aid flows and the purposes they serve, with an emphasis on agriculture, its components, and environmental protection.The data series “Other Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing (total)” provides additional information on aid that accrues in fact to agriculture, but is included in aid flows assigned to other sectors. Accrual to agriculture is dedicated from the text and the description of projects.    Among the indicators published in the DFA dataset is the Share of Total DFA. This is indicator is computed as a share of total aid flows devoted to “Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing” in Total aid flows, including Official Development Assistance (ODA), Other Official Flows (OOF) and Private Grant for all purposes from all donors. This indicator is conceptually similar to SDG indicator 2.a.2 \"Total official flows to the agriculture sector\", which is under the custodianship of the OECD with FAO as a partner Agency. It is important to underline that SDG 2.a.2 follows a methodology that is different from that of the Share of Total DFA published in FAOSTAT, and is described by OECD in the Handbook available at https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/SDGeHandbook/Indicator+2.a.2 .The computation of SDG indicator 2.a.2 uses ODA and OOF sector-allocable aid flows as a denominator.","Contact":"Piero Conforti, Eun Jeong LEE","Email":"faostat@fao.org / Investment-data@fao.org","DateUpdate":"2022-07-15T00:00:00","CompressionFormat":"zip","FileType":"csv","FileSize":"104663KB","FileRows":10917319,"FileLocation":"https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Development_Assistance_to_Agriculture_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip"}, {"DatasetCode":"EF","DatasetName":"Land, Inputs and Sustainability: Fertilizers indicators","Topic":"Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use","DatasetDescription":"The FAOSTAT domain Fertilizers Indicators provides information on three rations: a) the ratio between the totals by nutrient of agricultural use of chemical or mineral fertilizers, reported in the FAOSTAT domain “Inputs/Fertilizers by Nutrient” for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (expressed as P2O5) and potassium (expressed as K2O) and the area of cropland reported in the FAOSTAT domain “Inputs/Land Use”; b) The ratio of fertilizers use and the annual population reported in the FAOSTAT domain “Population and Employment/Population”; and c) The ratio of fertilizers use and the value of agricultural production reported in the FAOSTAT domain “Production/Value of Agricultural Production.Data are available at national, regional, and global level over the time series 1961-present.","Contact":"Francesco Nicola Tubiello","Email":"faostat@fao.org","DateUpdate":"2022-06-20T00:00:00","CompressionFormat":"zip","FileType":"csv","FileSize":"705KB","FileRows":93701,"FileLocation":"https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Environment_Fertilizers_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip"}, {"DatasetCode":"EI","DatasetName":"Climate Change: Emissions intensities","Topic":"Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use, Greenhouse Gas Emissions","DatasetDescription":"Intensities of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by unit of product for a selection of agricultural commodities.","Contact":"Francesco Nicola Tubiello","Email":"faostat@fao.org","DateUpdate":"2021-12-03T00:00:00","CompressionFormat":"zip","FileType":"csv","FileSize":"3079KB","FileRows":383574,"FileLocation":"https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Environment_Emissions_intensities_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip"}, {"DatasetCode":"EK","DatasetName":"Land, Inputs and Sustainability: Livestock Patterns","Topic":"Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (ISIC A)","DatasetDescription":"The Livestock Patterns domain of the FAOSTAT Agri-Environmental Indicators contains data on livestock numbers, shares of major livestock species and livestock densities in the agricultural land area.

Following the recommendation of experts gathered in the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) Round Table on hunger measurement, hosted at FAO headquarters in September 2011, an initial set of indicators aiming to capture various aspects of food insecurity is presented here. The choice of the indicators has been informed by expert judgment and the availability of data with sufficient coverage to enable comparisons across regions and over time. Many of these indicators are produced and published elsewhere by FAO and other international organizations. They are reported here in a single database with the aim of building a wide food security information system. More indicators will be added to this set as more data will become available. Indicators are classified along the four dimensions of food security -- availability, access, utilization and stability.

Data are available for all countries and territories, for standard FAOSTAT regional aggregations, and for Annex I and non-Annex I country groups.  The uncertainties in FAOSTAT estimates of emissions from fires in organic soils area very high (IPCC, 2014). FAOSTAT estimates rely on remotely sensed data of burning biomass in areas where organic soils are also mapped. On the one hand, the presence of fires may not always be a signal that the underlying peat layer is burning.  On the other hand, remote sensing information has limited capacity to detect the smoldering fires that are typical of peatlands.  Furthermore, the methods applied herein do not distinguish between fires on drained and undrained organic soils, rather assuming burning of the organic layer in both cases. Existing literature and country reports support FAOSTAT country estimates in South East Asia (e.g. Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei Darussalam), where burning of the organic layer is associated with deforestation fires and drainage. In all other countries, absence of literature and lack of other evidence suggest that FAOSTAT emissions data from fires in organic soils should be used with caution, as a tool to investigate possible national hotspots, rather than for evaluating national GHG inventory data. There is insufficient information to date to confirm the actual presence, quantity and causes (i.e. human-induced vs wildfires) of fires in organic soils outside Southeastern Asia.

The dataset also provides statistics on the total credit to all industries, indicators on the share of credit to agricultural producers, and an agriculture orientation index (AOI) for credit that normalizes the share of credit to agriculture over total credit by dividing it by the share of agriculture in gross domestic product (GDP). As such, it can provide a more accurate indication of the relative importance that banking sectors place on financing the sector. An AOI lower than 1 indicates that the agriculture sector receives a credit share lower than its contribution to the economy, while an AOI greater than 1 indicates a credit share to the agriculture sector greater than its economic contribution.","Contact":"Veronica Boero, Eun Jeong Lee","Email":"faostat@fao.org","DateUpdate":"2022-02-04T00:00:00","CompressionFormat":"zip","FileType":"csv","FileSize":"443KB","FileRows":50060,"FileLocation":"https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Investment_CreditAgriculture_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip"}, {"DatasetCode":"IG","DatasetName":"Investment: Government Expenditure","Topic":"Besides Total Expenditure, the GEA dataset covers expenditure in the following socio-economic sectors: Economic affairs; Agriculture, forestry and fishing; Agriculture; Forestry; Fishing and hunting; and Environmental Protection, as defined by COFOG.

Since 2018, to align with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014, countries report Central Government excluding Social Security Funds. Even though, for some countries the time series still refer to Central Government including Social Security Funds.

The IMF is the responsible institution for the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) methodology and annually collects GFS data, including Expenditure by Functions of Government (COFOG). The Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) is an international classification developed by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and published by the United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD), with the aim of categorise governments' functions according to their purposes. The FAO questionnaire aligns with Table 7 of the IMF GFS questionnaire, replicates the relevant aggregates and drills down to request additional detail related to Agriculture. The FAO dataset consists of a time series, from 2001 onwards, of Total Government Expenditure and expenditure in: Economic affairs; Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, along with its three disaggregated subsectors of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing; and Environmental Protection. In addition, expenditure in each detailed function are further disaggregated into Recurrent and Capital expenditure. Additional indicators include the Agriculture Share of Government Expenditure, and the Agriculture Orientation Index (ratio between the Agriculture Share of Government Expenditure and the Agriculture Value Added as Share of GDP). Imputation methods were used to provide a complete and consistent global dataset as some challenges arise with different stages of implementation of the GFS methodology and COFOG classification, and differences in the data collection and reporting at country level. Data are reported for the highest level of government available (Consolidated general government, consolidated central government or budgetary central government) and are available for about 100 countries on a regular basis. In some cases (for example, India and Pakistan), data may reflect the general government sector as per national norm. That is, budgetary central government combined with state government.","Contact":"Brian Carisma / Veronica Boero","Email":"Brian.Carisma@fao.org/Veronica.Boero@fao.org/Investment-Data@fao.org","DateUpdate":"2021-11-30T00:00:00","CompressionFormat":"zip","FileType":"csv","FileSize":"776KB","FileRows":76876,"FileLocation":"https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Investment_GovernmentExpenditure_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip"}, {"DatasetCode":"LC","DatasetName":"Land, Inputs and Sustainability: Land Cover","Topic":"Land cover; Environment; Land Accounting","DatasetDescription":"The FAOSTAT domain Land Cover under the Agri-Environmental Indicators section contains land cover information organized by the land cover classes of the international standard system for Environmental and Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA CF).

The pesticides traded for retail sale or as preparations or articles are those classified under code 38.08 in the Harmonized System Nomenclature (HS) and include: hazardous pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, disinfectants and other. For these pesticides, this domain contains trade data (imports and exports) in values only (current 1000 US dollars), and the time series extends from 1961 onwards. The pesticides traded as separate chemically defined compounds are those listed in Annex III of the Rotterdam Convention (excluding industrial chemicals) and therefore subject to the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure. The correspondence with the HS Nomenclature is shown in the table  at the Related Documents section. For these pesticides, this domain contains trade data (imports and exports) in both value (current 1000 US dollars) and quantity (net weight in tonnes), and the time series extends from 2007 onwards.","Contact":"Francesco Nicola Tubiello","Email":"faostat@fao.org","DateUpdate":"2022-06-17T00:00:00","CompressionFormat":"zip","FileType":"csv","FileSize":"1508KB","FileRows":163483,"FileLocation":"https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Inputs_Pesticides_Trade_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip"}, {"DatasetCode":"RY","DatasetName":"Discontinued archives and data series: Machinery Archive","Topic":null,"DatasetDescription":null,"Contact":null,"Email":null,"DateUpdate":"2021-12-03T00:00:00","CompressionFormat":"zip","FileType":"csv","FileSize":"1771KB","FileRows":328932,"FileLocation":"https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Investment_MachineryArchive_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip"}, {"DatasetCode":"SCL","DatasetName":"Food Balances: Supply Utilization Accounts","Topic":"Most crop and livestock products, including processed products, under agricultural activity.","DatasetDescription":"Supply Utilization Accounts and Food Balance Sheet present a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period. The food balance sheet shows for each food item - i.e. each primary commodity and a number of processed commodities potentially available for human consumption - the sources of supply and its utilization. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock, used for seed, put to manufacture for food use and non-food uses, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per caput supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking of it. Data on per caput food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and - by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products - also in terms of caloric value and protein and fat content.","Contact":"Mr. Salar Tayyib","Email":"faostat@fao.org","DateUpdate":"2022-02-11T00:00:00","CompressionFormat":"zip","FileType":"csv","FileSize":"62666KB","FileRows":10117501,"FileLocation":"https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/SUA_Crops_Livestock_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip"}, {"DatasetCode":"SDGB","DatasetName":"SDG Indicators: SDG Indicators","Topic":null,"DatasetDescription":"As the custodian agency of 21 SDG indicators, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is responsible for curating and refining the methodologies of these indicators, collecting data from national sources, ensuring their quality and compatibility with applicable standards and classifications, and disseminating data at global level.

An agricultural holding is an economic unit of agricultural production under single management comprising all livestock kept and all land used wholly or partly for agricultural production purposes. Member countries provided census data to FAO under the World Programme for the Census of Agriculture (WCA). National censuses are conducted at least once every ten years in an internationally comparable way. The ‘’Structural data from agricultural censuses’’ domain in FAOSTAT provides structural data from the last three WCA rounds (WCA 2010, 2000 and 1990) for each participating country and territory, to the extent possible. For earlier rounds (WCA 1930, 1950, 1960, 1970 and 1980) data are provided only on the number and area of holdings. The data are prepared based on the national census reports, later disseminated by FAO through the publications SDS 17, SDS 12 and SDS 9 and 9a.","Contact":"Jairo Castano","Email":"faostat@fao.org","DateUpdate":"2022-03-23T00:00:00","CompressionFormat":"zip","FileType":"csv","FileSize":"121KB","FileRows":11162,"FileLocation":"https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/World_Census_Agriculture_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip"}]
